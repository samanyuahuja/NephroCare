Here’s a prompt for an AI symptom checker page, plus a full list of your CKD input features with medical limits, ranges, and warnings that you can use both in your form validations and chatbot suggestions.

✅ Symptom Checker Prompt (for AI website builder)

⸻

Prompt:

Create a page titled “AI Symptom Checker – NephroCare” that allows users to click/select symptoms they are experiencing, and instantly get feedback on possible CKD severity, urgency, and next steps.

✅ Functional Requirements:
	•	Show a list of common CKD-related symptoms as toggleable checkboxes or cards.
	•	On submit, display:
	•	Severity estimate (Low/Moderate/High Concern)
	•	Possible causes (e.g. anemia, fluid retention, diabetes)
	•	Recommendation: e.g. “Please consult a nephrologist”, “Increase water intake”, etc.

✅ Symptoms List to Include:
	•	Persistent fatigue
	•	Swelling in legs or ankles
	•	Changes in urination (color, frequency)
	•	Foamy urine
	•	Nausea or vomiting
	•	Shortness of breath
	•	Loss of appetite
	•	Blood in urine (Hematuria)
	•	High blood pressure
	•	Itchy or dry skin
	•	Trouble concentrating
	•	Muscle cramps
	•	Back pain near the kidneys

Include a collapsible explanation section for each symptom with a small info icon.

At the bottom, add a “Start Diagnosis” button that takes the user to the full CKD form page.

✅ CKD Input Features – Ranges & Medical Limits

You can use these for:
	•	HTML5 input validation (min, max)
	•	Front-end warnings (e.g. red border + tooltip)
	•	AI model conditioning

Feature Name	Full Name	Typical Range	Warning Limit Examples
age	Age (years)	0 – 120	Warn if <10 or >90
bp	Blood Pressure (mmHg)	60 – 140	<60 = hypotension; >140 = high
sg	Specific Gravity	1.005 – 1.030	<1.005 or >1.030 = concern
al	Albumin (0–5 scale)	0 – 5	>3 = high proteinuria
su	Sugar (0–5 scale)	0 – 5	>2 may signal diabetes
rbc	Red Blood Cells	normal / abnormal	abnormal = hematuria
pc	Pus Cells	normal / abnormal	abnormal = infection
pcc	Pus Cell Clumps	present / not present	present = severe infection
bgr	Blood Glucose Random (mg/dL)	70 – 180	>200 = uncontrolled diabetes
bu	Blood Urea (mg/dL)	7 – 20 (normal)	>40 = kidney function loss
sc	Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)	0.6 – 1.3	>1.5 = declining kidney function
sod	Sodium (mEq/L)	135 – 145	<130 or >150 = risk
pot	Potassium (mEq/L)	3.5 – 5.0	>5.5 = hyperkalemia risk
hemo	Hemoglobin (g/dL)	12 – 17	<10 = anemia
wbcc	WBC Count (/µL)	4000 – 11000	<4000 or >15000 = infection
rbcc	RBC Count (million/µL)	4.2 – 6.0	<3.5 or >6.5 = abnormal
htn	Hypertension	yes / no	yes = risk factor
dm	Diabetes Mellitus	yes / no	yes = high risk
appet	Appetite	good / poor	poor = later CKD stage
pe	Pedal Edema	yes / no	yes = fluid retention
ane	Anemia	yes / no	yes = low hemoglobin
bun_sc_ratio	BUN / Creatinine Ratio	10 – 20	<10 = liver issue; >20 = CKD
hemo_bu	Hemoglobin × Blood Urea	—	Computed: low = risk indicator
high_creatinine	High Creatinine Flag	0 / 1	1 = yes, flag for severity

Let me know if you want these validations implemented in HTML, React, or Flask routes — I can write exact code blocks.
