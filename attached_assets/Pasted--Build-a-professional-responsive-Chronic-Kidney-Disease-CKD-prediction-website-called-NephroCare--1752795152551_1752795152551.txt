	•	CKD prediction score (e.g. “High Risk: 87%”)
	•	Risk Level Badge (Low/Moderate/High)
	•	Visual explanation cards:
	•	SHAP plot of top 4 influencing features
	•	Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)
	•	LIME Local Explanation
	•	AI chatbot below results for user questions
	•	Button: “Generate AI Diet Plan”
	•	Button: “Download Report (PDF)”

⸻

4. Diet Plan Page

Auto-generated AI-based diet plan based on top 3 features from SHAP values (e.g. high creatinine, low hemoglobin).
	•	Toggle: Vegetarian / Non-Vegetarian

5. Chatbot Page

An interactive AI assistant that answers questions like:
	•	“What does high creatinine mean?”

This site will be later linked to a Python Flask backend (app.py) that handles predictions and API. Add buttons/forms with proper id and name attributes to match the backend.
