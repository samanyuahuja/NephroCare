🩺 About This App

NephroCare AI is an intelligent Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) screening and awareness platform built with compassion, purpose, and a deep sense of social responsibility. This AI-powered tool helps users assess their kidney health using clinical lab values, symptoms, and medical history — delivering personalized insights, diet recommendations, and risk assessments in just a few clicks.

The app was developed by Samanyu Ahuja, a high school student from India with a passion for healthcare, technology, and social impact. With a strong academic foundation in computer science and biology, Samanyu created this platform to bridge the gap between early-stage kidney health awareness and accessible digital tools, especially in regions where diagnostic resources are limited.

Early detection of CKD can significantly improve treatment outcomes and delay disease progression. Yet, many individuals remain unaware of the warning signs until it’s too late. NephroCare AI aims to change that by offering a user-friendly interface where anyone can input values like blood pressure, serum creatinine, albumin levels, and more — and get an instant AI-generated CKD risk score, SHAP/LIME-based feature explanations, and dynamic diet plans tailored to their unique needs.

🔍 Key Features:
	•	Smart CKD prediction using 20+ medical indicators
	•	Risk level badge (Low / Moderate / High)
	•	AI-generated diet plan with veg/non-veg toggle and PDF download
	•	GPT-powered chatbot for questions and report explanations
	•	Interactive symptom checker for fast self-screening
	•	Visual explanations (SHAP, PDP, LIME) for transparency
	•	Hindi ↔ English language toggle for wider accessibility
	•	Mobile-ready, responsive design with session history and export options

This app is not meant to replace a doctor but to educate, empower, and guide users in understanding their kidney health better — especially in the early stages where intervention can make a huge difference.

As a student, Samanyu believes in the power of merging AI and healthcare for meaningful change. Whether you’re managing an existing kidney condition, monitoring lab values, or just staying informed, NephroCare AI is here to support your journey.

Thank you for using this app. We hope it encourages you to take your health into your own hands — and never ignore the signs your body gives you.
