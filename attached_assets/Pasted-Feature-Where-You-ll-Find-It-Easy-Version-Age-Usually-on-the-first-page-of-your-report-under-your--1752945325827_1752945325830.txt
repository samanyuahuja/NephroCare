Where You’ll Find It (Easy Version)
Age
Usually on the first page of your report under your name or personal details.
Blood Pressure (bp)
In the doctor’s notes or in the “Vital Signs” section (e.g., 120/80 mmHg).
Specific Gravity (sg)
In the “Urine Test” or “Urine Routine” section — look for “SG” or “Specific Gravity.”
Albumin (al)
Found in the “Urine Test” — look for protein levels or “Albumin.” It’s often a number from 0 to 5.
Sugar (su)
Also in the “Urine Test” section — it shows how much sugar is in your urine.
Red Blood Cells (rbc)
In the “Urine Microscopy” section — listed as “RBC” or “Red Cells.”
Pus Cells (pc)
Also in “Urine Microscopy” — shows if there’s any infection.
Pus Cell Clumps (pcc)
In the same section as above — it may say “Clumps present” if there’s an infection.
Blood Glucose Random (bgr)
In the “Blood Sugar” section — this is your sugar level when tested randomly.
Blood Urea (bu)
Found in the “Kidney Function Test” (KFT) — look for “Urea” or “Blood Urea.”
Serum Creatinine (sc)
Also in the “Kidney Function Test” — this tells how well your kidneys are working.
Sodium (sod)
Look under “Electrolytes” — Sodium may be written as “Na+” too.
Potassium (pot)
In the same “Electrolytes” section — Potassium may be written as “K+.”
Hemoglobin (hemo)
In the “Complete Blood Count” or “CBC” test — shows if you’re low on blood (anemia).
White Blood Cells (wbcc)
Also in CBC — may be written as “WBC count.”

Appetite (appet)
Doctors may write this in their notes during your check-up.
Swelling in Feet (pe)
Not in tests — doctors check this in physical exam or observation.
BU/SC Ratio
You can calculate this by dividing your urea (BU) by creatinine (SC).
High Creatinine (high_creatinine)
If creatinine is above 1.2 — then it’s “high.” Your app will show this.
Hemoglobin × BU (hemo_bu)
Your app will multiply your hemoglobin and urea to get this value.
